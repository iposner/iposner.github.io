I lead the [Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/a2i/) (A2I) at Oxford University. In 2016 I co-founded the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk). In 2014 I co-founded [Oxbotica](https://www.oxbotica.com), a leading provider of mobile-autonomy software solutions.

I care deeply about enabling robots to robustly and effectively operate in complex, real-world environments.
